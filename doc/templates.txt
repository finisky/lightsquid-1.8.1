totaly rewrite LightSquid .cgi part

now use HTML TEMPLATES, in .cgi files - only programm logic, more clear and easy modification.

detail:
in config now 2 new variable

   #html template name (see tpl folder)
   $templatename        ="base";

   #color for selected item (year, month, ...)
   $selectedcolor       ="#44CC77";
   
templates in `tpl` folder, (now contain only `base` template)

if you need modification - copy `base` folder in new, hack it, and modify $templatename variable

templates - simple HTML file with some macros

##VARIABLE## - replaces by corresponding value

<!-- [[ blockname start-->
  repeatable block
<!-- ]] blockname end-->  

uses when build report list

<!-- HIDE oversize start -->
        hided block
<!-- HIDE oversize end -->

block deleted from html if called HideTPL("oversize");

trying play with it,

!!WARNING!! -  all ##VARIABLE## and block must be in your file !!!!!!!

templates very simple and dumb.
